# Exercise 0: The Setup

This exercise has no code. It is simply the exercise you complete to get your computer to run Ruby. You should follow these instructions as exactly as possible. For example, Mac OS X computers already have Ruby 2, so do not install Ruby 3 (or any Ruby).

> # WARNING
> If you do not know how to use PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on OS X, or bash on Linux then you need to go learn that first. You should do the exercises in Appendix A first before continuing with these exercises.


# Mac OS X
Do the following tasks to complete this exercise:

> - Go to http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/ with your browser, get the TextWrangler text editor, and install it.
> -  Put TextWrangler (your editor) in your dock so you can reach it easily.
> - Find your Terminal program. Search for it. You will find it.
> - Put your Terminal in your dock as well.
> - Run your Terminal program. It won't look like much.
> - In your Terminal program, run ruby -v to get your Ruby version.
> - If ruby says anything less than "2.0" then your Ruby is too old. You have three choices at this point:


> > Upgrade your OS X to the latest version. It's free now so there's no excuse.
> > Go to https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ and try one of the installers there.
> > Ask a friend to help you install Ruby 2.x or greater.
