# Exercise 0: The Setup

This exercise has no code. It is simply the exercise you complete to get your computer to run Ruby. You should follow these instructions as exactly as possible. For example, Mac OS X computers already have Ruby 2, so do not install Ruby 3 (or any Ruby).

> WARNING
> If you do not know how to use PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on OS X, or bash on Linux then you need to go learn that first. You should do the exercises in Appendix A first before continuing with these exercises.
